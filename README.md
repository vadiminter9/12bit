# 12bit
A fictional game console that could appear in the interval between Nes 8 (bit) and Sega (16 bit).
We are trying to create games for that console and framework for game developing.
We use js and html canvas for development.

Specification of the console:
- Screen resolution: 320 x 180;
- 12 color can be shown on screen simultaniously;
- 512 colors palete. Each color can be specified using 4 bit length number (12 bit in total for all 3 colors);
